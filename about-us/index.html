                <p class="about-text">
                    LegisAlert was created to amplify the voices of Hoosiers in the democratic process by making civic engagement more accessible. 
                    Think of us as platforms like <span class="highlight">5Calls or Call Your Rep, but specifically focused on Indiana state legislation</span>. 
                    We believe that informed and active citizens are essential to a healthy democracy, but the complexities of the legislative process often create barriers to participation.
                </p>
                <p class="about-text">
                    Our mission is to <span class="highlight">simplify civic engagement</span> by providing tools that help Indiana residents track legislation, understand policy issues, 
                    and effectively communicate with their elected representatives.
                    By breaking down these barriers, we aim to create a more inclusive, responsive, and accountable state government.

                <p><strong>Progressive Perspective:</strong> Our call scripts are written from a progressive point of view, focusing on social justice, equity, environmental protection, 
                    and economic opportunity for all Hoosiers. We believe in transparent advocacy and are clear about the values that inform our work.</p>

                <h2 class="about-subtitle">Why This Matters</h2>
                <p class="about-text">
                    The Indiana General Assembly makes decisions that affect every aspect of our daily lives—from education and healthcare to environmental regulations and civil rights.
                    Yet the legislative process remains opaque to many, and the voices of everyday citizens are too often drowned out by powerful special interests.
                </p>
                <p class="about-text">
                    Making a phone call to your representative might seem like a small act, but it has real impact. Legislative offices track constituent communications, 
                    and even a handful of calls on an issue can influence a legislator's position.
                    When you understand the issues and speak up, you become part of a collective voice for positive change.
