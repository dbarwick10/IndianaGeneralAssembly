                        <p>The House Republicans have made it a priority to trim Indianaâ€™s education code. In doing so, they are <a href="https://indianapublicmedia.org/news/deregulation-bill-would-trim-licensure-education-requirements-for-indiana-secretary-of-education.php">removing the requirements</a> to be the secretary of education. The bill also removes requirements that a governing body of a school corporation that <a href="https://www.wboi.org/2025-01-22/lawmakers-debate-changes-to-charter-school-rules-secretary-of-education-in-deregulation-bill">operates a charter school must also operate a public school</a>.</p>
                            <p>Education funding will see an elimination of the Curricular Material Reimbursement Fund, which was used to provide curricular reimbursements to public school and certain nonpublic school students. In Fiscal Year 2025 this amounted to $160 million. The wealthiest Hoosiers are able to save money while public schools could see more cuts to their budgets as the annual income maximum for choice scholarships is removed.</p>

                                <p>I'm calling to express my opposition to House Bills 1001. This bill would reduce public education funding through choice scholarships and significantly cut curricular materials funds, which I find deeply concerning.</p>
                                <p>I also want to voice my concerns about House Bill 1002. I believe the Secretary of Education position requires substantial education experience to effectively lead Indiana's schools.</p>
                                <p>Strong public education is essential for our state's future, and I urge [Rep./Sen. Name] to support increased investment in our schools and educators rather than these cuts.</p>
