# Climate Change Legislation

## Description

Climate change continues to be a pressing issue for Indiana legislators. Recent climate data shows that Indiana is experiencing [more frequent flooding](https://example.com/indiana-floods) and extreme weather events, causing significant impacts on agriculture and infrastructure.

The state has begun addressing these challenges through various legislative measures focused on:

* Renewable energy development
* Carbon emissions reduction
    * Climate resilience funding
    * Agricultural adaptation strategies

In the current session, several bills have been introduced that would impact Indiana's approach to climate policy, including measures to both accelerate and restrict climate action.

Some key stakeholders include:

1. Environmental advocacy groups
2. Energy industry representatives 
3. Agricultural associations
4. Local government coalitions

## Analysis

Recent polling indicates that **67% of Hoosiers** support increased renewable energy investment, while only 42% support carbon pricing mechanisms.

The economic impact assessment for these bills shows:

| Bill    | Estimated Cost | Projected Benefits | Jobs Impact    |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| HB 1220 | $45 million    | $120 million      | +1,200         |
| SB 114  | $75 million    | $90 million       | -300 to +500   |
| HB 553  | $30 million    | $60 million       | +850           |

```python
# Sample code showing emissions reduction projections
def calculate_reduction(baseline, reduction_rate, years):
    result = []
    for year in range(years):
        baseline = baseline * (1 - reduction_rate)
        result.append(baseline)
    return result

# Current emissions and projected reduction with HB 1220
emissions = calculate_reduction(10000, 0.03, 10)  # 3% annual reduction

## Call Script
Hi, my name is [NAME] and I’m a constituent from [CITY, ZIP].

I’m calling to urging [REP/SEN NAME] to object HB 1393. This bill would require every local and state law enforcement officer in Indiana to inappropriately stand in for federal immigration officers. The result will be an increase in the profiling of Hoosiers based on race, appearance, and English proficiency. 

Thank you for your time and consideration.
