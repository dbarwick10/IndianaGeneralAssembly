# HB 1041: Transgender Athletes In Higher Education

## Description
This bill would prohibit transgender women from participating in women's sports at Indiana's state and private postsecondary educational institutions. The legislation requires colleges to designate athletic teams as male, female, or coeducational, and explicitly bars students who were male at birth (based on genetics and reproductive biology) from participating on women's teams.

The bill establishes grievance procedures that would allow students or parents to file complaints against institutions for violations. More significantly, it creates a pathway for civil lawsuits by students who believe they were deprived of athletic opportunities due to violations, with potential remedies including injunctive relief, damages up to $1,000, and attorney's fees.

This legislation expands Indiana's existing transgender sports ban beyond K-12 schools to the college level, scheduled to take effect July 1, 2025 if passed. The bill appears focused specifically on excluding transgender women from women's collegiate sports, without addressing other transgender athletes or situations.

## Call Script
Hi, my name is [NAME] and I’m a constituent from [CITY, ZIP].

I’m calling to demand [REP/SEN NAME] to oppose HB 1041. This bill seeks to regulate participation in interscholastic sports based on biological sex at birth, but similar policies are already in place through athletic associations like the IHSAA, NCAA, and NAIA. Passing HB 1041 would duplicate these efforts and further marginalize transgender Hoosiers, making them feel targeted and excluded. Instead of reinforcing division, we should focus on creating inclusive policies that support all students and ensure they have equal opportunities to participate in sports. Thank you for considering my perspective.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
