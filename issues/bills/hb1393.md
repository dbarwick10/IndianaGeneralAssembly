# HB 1393: Immigration Notice

## Description
This bill would require law enforcement officers in Indiana to notify the county sheriff when they arrest someone for a felony or misdemeanor and have probable cause to believe the person is not lawfully present in the United States. This notification would occur during the intake process at jail or detention facilities.

The legislation also mandates that officers must arrest individuals for misdemeanors rather than issuing summonses if they have probable cause to believe the person is not lawfully present in the United States. County sheriffs would then be required to report this information to "the proper authority" in accordance with existing provisions.

The bill provides immunity from civil liability for law enforcement agencies, sheriffs, officers, and other employees if they reasonably believe they have fulfilled these notification requirements.

HB 1393 effectively expands the role of state and local law enforcement in immigration matters by requiring them to take specific actions when encountering individuals they suspect of being undocumented, rather than leaving such matters to federal immigration authorities. The bill is scheduled to take effect July 1, 2025 if passed.

## Call Script
Hi, my name is [NAME] and I’m a constituent from [CITY, ZIP].

I’m calling to urge [REP/SEN NAME] to oppose HB 1393. This bill forces local law enforcement to act like ICE agents by requiring them to report and arrest individuals they suspect are undocumented, even for misdemeanors. This will lead to racial profiling based on appearance, race, or language, harming immigrant communities.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
