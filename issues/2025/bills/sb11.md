# SB 11: Minor Access and Use of Social Media

## Description
Senate Bill 11 aims to restrict minors' access to social media platforms without parental approval. The bill would require social media operators to implement systems requiring verifiable parental consent before allowing users under 16 years of age to view or access social media content.

The legislation defines "social media" as websites or applications that allow users to create profiles, communicate with others, and create, share, or view content. Several exceptions are carved out, including gaming platforms, workplace communication tools, email services, platforms with only pre-selected content, and applications for creating visual aids like charts or infographics.

Under the bill, social media companies would need to identify accounts created by users under 16 and restrict access until obtaining parental consent. They must notify parents that consent can be revoked anytime and establish procedures for revocation. Companies would also be required to use "commercially reasonable methods" to secure all collected information and encrypt all information collected and retained under this chapter.

The bill grants enforcement authority to the Indiana Attorney General, who would first need to send a notice of violation to a social media operator that hasn't previously been subject to enforcement. The operator would then have 90 days to remedy the violation. If not corrected, the Attorney General could seek injunctive relief, civil penalties up to $250,000, and costs associated with investigation and legal action. The bill includes confidentiality protections for information about minor users in legal proceedings and is scheduled to take effect July 1, 2025, if passed.

## Call Script
Hi, my name is [NAME] and Iâ€™m a constituent from [STREET, CITY, ZIP].

I'm contacting [REP/SEN NAME] to demand they oppose SB 11, which would require parental consent for minors under 16 to access social media. While protecting young people online is important, this approach raises serious First Amendment concerns. Courts have consistently struck down similar laws restricting minors' access to constitutionally protected content. Rather than passing legislation that will likely face legal challenges and could harm young people who depend on these platforms for support and information, I urge lawmakers to invest in digital literacy education, better tools for parents, and increased mental health resources for youth. Parents already have the right to restrict their children's social media use without government mandates that infringe on constitutional freedoms.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
