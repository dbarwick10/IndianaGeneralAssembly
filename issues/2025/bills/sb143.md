# SB 143: Parental Rights

## Description
Senate Bill 143 would create sweeping new liabilities for Indiana governmental entities and their employees who interact with children, establishing an expansive "parental rights" framework that could significantly impede the ability of teachers, counselors, and other public employees to serve children's needs. Under this legislation, governmental entities would be prohibited from "substantially burdening" parental control over children's upbringing, religious instruction, education, and healthcare unless they can prove a compelling governmental interest and that they're using the least restrictive means available—a high legal standard that could chill appropriate professional judgment.

The bill would require government employees to disclose virtually any information about a child to parents upon request, with insufficient protections for children's privacy or safety. By prohibiting employees from "advising, directing, or coercing" a child to withhold information from parents, the legislation fails to recognize legitimate scenarios where confidentiality might protect a child's wellbeing. Most concerningly, it creates a pathway for parents to sue governmental entities and employees, imposing a "clear and convincing evidence" burden of proof on the government defendant. This represents a significant expansion of liability that could make public employees hesitant to take appropriate actions to support children, particularly vulnerable youth whose interests may sometimes diverge from their parents'. While claiming to support families, this bill actually threatens to undermine the careful balance between parental authority and children's independent rights and welfare.

## Call Script
Hi, my name is [NAME] and I’m a constituent from [STREET, CITY, ZIP].

I'm contacting [REP/SEN NAME] to demand they oppose SB 143, the so-called "parental rights" bill. This legislation creates dangerous new liabilities for teachers, counselors, and other government employees who work with children. By requiring these professionals to disclose virtually any information about a child to parents upon request, with very limited exceptions, the bill fails to properly balance parental authority with the privacy and safety needs of vulnerable young people. The bill's vague language about "substantially burdening" parental rights could prevent school staff from providing appropriate support to students, especially LGBTQ+ youth or those in difficult home situations. Rather than protecting families, SB 143 puts children at risk by undermining the trusted relationships they develop with teachers and counselors who may be their only safe resource. We need policies that thoughtfully balance parental involvement with appropriate protections for children's wellbeing, not this overreaching legislation that creates new legal traps for dedicated public servants.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
