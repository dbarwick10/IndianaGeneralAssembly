# SB 289: Nondiscrimination in Employment and Education

## Description
SB 289 imposes significant restrictions on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in Indiana’s state agencies, schools, and public employment. It prohibits state agencies from funding DEI offices or hiring DEI officers, with exceptions only for compliance with anti-discrimination laws. Schools and agencies are also required to publicly post DEI-related training and curricular materials online, a measure framed as promoting transparency but potentially discouraging open discussions about race, equity, and inclusion.

The bill further bans schools and agencies from compelling individuals to adopt specific beliefs about race, sex, or ethnicity and prohibits the promotion of stereotypes. It establishes a complaint process for employees, parents, or students to report violations, with the Attorney General authorized to investigate and impose fines up to $250,000 for noncompliance. Health profession licensing boards are barred from requiring DEI training, and state educational institutions must use standardized admissions tests for health programs, which critics argue could limit holistic evaluations of applicants.

By curtailing DEI efforts, SB 289 risks undermining progress toward creating inclusive environments in public institutions. While framed as promoting accountability, the bill’s restrictions could stifle meaningful conversations about systemic inequities and hinder efforts to address discrimination in education and employment.

## Call Script
Hi, my name is [NAME] and I’m a constituent from [STREET, CITY, ZIP].

I'm contacting [REP/SEN NAME] to demand they oppose SB 289. This bill redefines diversity, equity, and inclusion in a way that narrows its scope and replaces it with a limited framework for nondiscrimination. By banning state agencies from funding DEI offices and requiring schools to publicly post DEI-related materials, the bill stifles meaningful efforts to address systemic inequities and create inclusive environments. Rather than fostering true equity, SB 289 sets up a watered-down version of nondiscrimination that fails to address the root causes of inequality. We need policies that actively promote inclusion and understanding, not ones that undermine progress and silence important conversations.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
