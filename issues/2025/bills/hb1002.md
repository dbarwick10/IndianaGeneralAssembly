# HB 1002: Various Education Matters

## Description
House Bill 1002 removes the specific qualification requirements for who can be appointed as Indiana's Secretary of Education.
Currently, Indiana law requires that a person appointed as Secretary of Education must:

* Have resided in Indiana for at least two years before appointment
* Have demonstrated personal and professional leadership success, preferably in educational administration
* Possess an advanced degree (preferably in education or educational administration) from an accredited college or university
* Meet one of these experience requirements:

    * Be licensed or employed as a teacher, principal, or superintendent at the time of appointment
    * Have previously held a license as a teacher, superintendent, or principal for at least five years
    * Have at least five years of work experience as a teacher, superintendent, principal, or educational executive



HB 1002 bill eliminates all of these specific qualifications, leaving only the basic appointment process in place. Under the amended law, the Secretary of Education would still be appointed by the Governor and serve at the Governor's pleasure, but without any statutorily required educational background or experience.

This change would grant the Governor significantly more flexibility in appointing the Secretary of Education position with fewer statutory constraints on candidate qualifications.

## Call Script
Hi, my name is [NAME] and Iâ€™m a constituent from [STREET, CITY, ZIP].

I'm contacting [REP/SEN NAME] to urge them to amend HB 1002, which removes all qualification requirements for Indiana's Secretary of Education. This bill eliminates requirements that this critical education leader have an advanced degree, teaching experience, or any educational background whatsoever. By removing these professional standards, HB 1002 opens the door to appointing politically-connected individuals with no education expertise to oversee our entire state education system. Our children's education should be led by qualified professionals who understand classroom needs, not political appointees without relevant experience. Please amend HB 1002 to preserve the essential qualification requirements for the Secretary of Education position.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
