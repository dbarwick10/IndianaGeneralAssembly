# SB 442: Instruction Concerning Human Sexuality

## Description
Senate Bill 442 would establish new requirements for schools that provide instruction on human sexuality to students in grades 4 through 12. The bill mandates that school governing authorities (school boards or charter school equivalents) must approve several aspects of human sexuality instruction before each school year begins, including which weeks the instruction will be taught, whether male and female students will be taught together or separately, who will teach the instruction, and a description of topics to be covered. All learning materials related to human sexuality must be approved by the governing authority and published on the school's website in a "conspicuous place."

The legislation would also require that when schools send parents consent forms for human sexuality instruction, they must include a direct link to the school website where the approved instructional materials and information are posted. Schools would be prohibited from using any materials that haven't been pre-approved by their governing authority. Additionally, the bill establishes that parents or adult students may submit grievances regarding violations of these requirements, and schools must create and maintain a grievance procedure to address such complaints.

## Call Script
Hi, my name is [NAME] and Iâ€™m a constituent from [STREET, CITY, ZIP].

I'm calling [REP/SEN NAME] to oppose SB 442 concerning instruction on human sexuality. This bill creates unnecessary bureaucracy by requiring school boards to pre-approve and publicly post all human sexuality teaching materials. School boards already have this authority - the bill only politicizes sexual health education and creates additional hurdles for educators. Quality health education is critical for young people, and this legislation could discourage schools from providing comprehensive instruction due to administrative burden and potential controversy. We should trust educators and existing school governance structures while ensuring students receive medically accurate information, not introduce legislation that solves no real problem while potentially restricting students' access to important health education.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
