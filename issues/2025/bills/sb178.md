# SB 178: Natural Gas and Propane as a Clean Energy Resources

## Description
Indiana Senate Bill 178 seeks to reclassify fossil fuels like natural gas and propane as "clean energy" resources, making them eligible for funding intended for renewable energy sources. This misleading legislation originated in Ohio and has now made its way to Indiana through the efforts of the Empowerment Alliance, a dark money group with ties to the gas industry, and the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC). By creating a definition that only requires emissions to meet the standard of pipeline natural gas, this bill ignores scientific consensus about fossil fuel contributions to climate change. The legislation would divert critical funding away from truly clean energy solutions like wind and solar power, undermining Indiana's potential to address climate change while securing fossil fuel interests a share of clean energy funding. This represents part of a coordinated multi-state campaign to rebrand fossil fuels as environmentally friendly despite their significant carbon emissions.

The legislation is designed to divert limited clean energy resources toward fossil fuel infrastructure by creating a definition that merely requires emissions not exceed "standard emissions levels associated with pipeline quality natural gas." This ignores the significant methane leakage throughout the natural gas supply chain and comes at a time when climate science increasingly demonstrates the urgent need to transition away from all fossil fuels. By conflating carbon-emitting energy sources with zero-carbon alternatives, the bill would impede Indiana's progress toward meaningful climate action and authentic decarbonization of its energy sector.

## Call Script
Hi, my name is [NAME] and Iâ€™m a constituent from [STREET, CITY, ZIP].

I'm calling to urge [REP/SEN NAME] to oppose SB 178, which attempts to reclassify fossil fuels like natural gas and propane as "clean energy" resources despite their significant carbon emissions and environmental impacts. This bill would make these fossil fuels eligible for funding intended for genuine renewable energy by creating a definition that only requires emissions to meet the standard of pipeline natural gas, ignoring the urgent climate science showing we must transition away from all fossil fuels. By grouping these carbon-emitting fuels alongside legitimate clean energy sources like wind and solar, SB 178 would divert critical funding away from truly sustainable energy solutions, undermining Indiana's ability to address climate change and transition to a renewable energy future. Please vote against this misleading legislation and support genuine clean energy policies instead.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
