# SB 178: Natural Gas and Propane as a Clean Energy Resources

## Description
Indiana Senate Bill 178 represents a troubling attempt to redefine fossil fuels as "clean energy" by classifying natural gas and propane alongside truly renewable sources like wind, solar and hydropower. This reclassification would make these fossil fuels eligible for clean energy funding initiatives, despite their significant contributions to climate change through greenhouse gas emissions.

The legislation is designed to divert limited clean energy resources toward fossil fuel infrastructure by creating a definition that merely requires emissions not exceed "standard emissions levels associated with pipeline quality natural gas." This ignores the significant methane leakage throughout the natural gas supply chain and comes at a time when climate science increasingly demonstrates the urgent need to transition away from all fossil fuels. By conflating carbon-emitting energy sources with zero-carbon alternatives, the bill would impede Indiana's progress toward meaningful climate action and authentic decarbonization of its energy sector.

## Call Script
Hi, my name is [NAME] and Iâ€™m a constituent from [STREET, CITY, ZIP].

I'm calling to urge [REP/SEN NAME] to oppose SB 178, which attempts to reclassify fossil fuels like natural gas and propane as "clean energy" resources despite their significant carbon emissions and environmental impacts. This bill would make these fossil fuels eligible for funding intended for genuine renewable energy by creating a definition that only requires emissions to meet the standard of pipeline natural gas, ignoring the urgent climate science showing we must transition away from all fossil fuels. By grouping these carbon-emitting fuels alongside legitimate clean energy sources like wind and solar, SB 178 would divert critical funding away from truly sustainable energy solutions, undermining Indiana's ability to address climate change and transition to a renewable energy future. Please vote against this misleading legislation and support genuine clean energy policies instead.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
