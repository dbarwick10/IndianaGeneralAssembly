# SB 10: Voter Registration

## Description
Senate Bill 10 proposes several changes to Indiana's voter registration and list maintenance processes. One key provision would prohibit documents issued by educational institutions from being used as proof of identification for voting purposes, effectively eliminating student IDs as acceptable forms of voter identification. Voters must still meet state requirements to register, but the ID presented at the polls is solely intended to verify the voter’s identity and ensure they are who they claim to be—making the elimination of student IDs particularly concerning. The bill also expands the circumstances under which individuals can be removed from voter rolls, requiring county voter registration offices to conduct maintenance programs targeting voters who haven't cast ballots in the two most recent general elections.

The legislation has raised concerns among student advocates. As reported by the Indiana Capital Chronicle, Daniel Jenkins, outreach director for the College Democrats of Indiana, opposes the bill, noting its potential impact on students: "For many of these students, voting in Indiana is their only option — as some states make it very difficult or impossible to vote by mail." Jenkins shared a personal example of how the proposed change could disenfranchise students: "Dejected, she registered here in Indiana and was able to vote only because of her student ID, as it was her only Indiana-issued ID. If this legislation was in effect, she likely would not have been able to vote at all."

Other provisions of the bill would require local health officers to share all death records and certificates with county voter registration offices quarterly and direct Indiana's NVRA official to annually contact states to request they join IDEA, a multi-state voter registration data-sharing program. The bill establishes a points-based "confidence factor" system for identifying potential duplicate registrations across states.

## Call Script
Hi, my name is [NAME] and I’m a constituent from [STREET, CITY, ZIP].

I'm contacting [REP/SEN NAME] to demand they oppose SB 10, a bill that would create unnecessary barriers to voting for Hoosiers. This legislation would prohibit the use of student IDs, even those issued by state universities, as valid voter identification, disenfranchising thousands of college students who rely on them as their only form of photo ID. Additionally, SB 10 would implement an aggressive voter purge program targeting those who haven’t voted in just two general elections, disproportionately impacting minorities, low-income voters, and naturalized citizens. Indiana already ranks among the lowest states for voter participation, and instead of addressing nonexistent issues like widespread improper voter registration, we should be making it easier for eligible citizens to vote. I urge you to oppose SB 10 and support measures that encourage civic participation rather than depress turnout.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
