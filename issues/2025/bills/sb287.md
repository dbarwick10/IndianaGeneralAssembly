# SB 287: School Board Matters

## Description

Senate Bill 287 represents an effort to inject partisan politics into local education governance by forcing school board candidates to declare party affiliations. This legislation would undermine the longstanding nonpartisan nature of school boards that has allowed members to focus on educational outcomes rather than political ideologies. By requiring candidates to state whether they're affiliated with a political party, independent, or nonpartisan, the bill creates a partisan filter for education leadership that would prioritize political loyalty over qualifications and community focus. The bill would also open the door to partisan funding of school board races, allowing political parties and well-funded special interest groups to dramatically outspend grassroots candidates, creating an uneven playing field that would make it nearly impossible for concerned parents and educators without party backing to successfully run for these crucial positions.

The legislation also increases school board member compensation from $2,000 to up to 10% of the lowest teacher salary in their district, which could divert resources from classrooms while creating financial incentives for political operatives to seek these positions. While the bill does require voters to make separate marks for school board candidates (even when voting straight-party tickets), this minor safeguard does little to counteract the fundamental politicization of education governance. This bill reflects a broader agenda to expand partisan control into traditionally nonpartisan spheres of public service, potentially subordinating educational priorities to political ones when schools should be focused on meeting student needs, not advancing political agendas.

## Call Script
Hi, my name is [NAME] and Iâ€™m a constituent from [STREET, CITY, ZIP].

I'm calling to urge [REP/SEN NAME] to vote against Senate Bill 287, which would inject partisan politics into our schools by forcing school board candidates to declare political party affiliations. This concerning legislation would undermine the traditionally nonpartisan nature of school boards, creating a system where party loyalty would take precedence over educational qualifications. The bill's provision to fill vacancies through partisan caucuses for major party members grants political parties inappropriate influence over education. With SB 287, political parties and special interest groups would easily outspend grassroots candidates, making it impossible for concerned parents and educators without party backing to win election. Please vote to keep partisan politics out of our school boards and ensure education decisions remain focused on what's best for our students, not political agendas.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
