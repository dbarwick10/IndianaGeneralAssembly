# SB 2: Medicaid Matters

## Description
Senate Bill 2 implements multiple restrictions to the state's Medicaid program. The legislation establishes 20-hour weekly work requirements for many adult Medicaid recipients, with some exceptions for parents of young children, individuals in treatment programs, and those medically certified as unfit for employment. Senate Bill 2 mandates extensive data sharing between state and federal agencies, requiring monthly monitoring of recipients through multiple databases to detect changes that might affect eligibility.

New performance standards for hospitals making presumptive eligibility determinations introduce a three-strike system where facilities can lose their ability to make these determinations. This legislation allows the state to amend its Medicaid plan to exclude the adult expansion population and caps enrollment at 500,000 individuals. The office of the secretary must report annually on Medicaid data to oversight committees and terminate the Healthy Indiana Plan if federal funding drops below 90 percent.

Existing language that allowed providers to market their services, special therapies, children's units, and other healthcare offerings under the Medicaid program is repealed under these provisions. The office of the secretary must delay amending the Medicaid state plan until negotiations with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for a "3.0 plan waiver" are completed. Additionally, annual reporting to the budget committee on enforcement of the Medicaid five-year look-back period is mandated, examining financial transactions made by applicants seeking long-term care coverage.

## Call Script
Hi, my name is [NAME] and Iâ€™m a constituent from [STREET, CITY, ZIP].

I'm contacting [REP/SEN NAME] to urge they oppose Senate Bill 2, which would strip healthcare access from thousands of vulnerable Hoosiers by imposing unnecessary 20-hour work requirements, implementing excessive monitoring systems through multiple databases, prohibiting outreach about the program, and capping enrollment at just 500,000 people regardless of need. Healthcare is a fundamental human right, not a privilege to be earned through bureaucratic hurdles, and this bill's true purpose seems to be finding ways to kick people off Medicaid rather than ensuring those who need care can access it. I urge you to stand for the healthcare rights of all Hoosiers by opposing SB2 and instead supporting measures that expand access to quality, affordable healthcare for everyone in our state.
