# Partisan Redistricting in Indiana

## Description

Update: Due to overwhelming opposition, HB 1032 did not pass!

Indiana state politicians are attempting to redraw congressional maps mid-decade for partisan advantage. The Indiana constitution calls for redistricting once per decade based on Census data to accurately reflect population changes and ensure fair representation. Fair redistricting means creating maps that represent actual communities and their diversity, not politicians' interests. When done properly, redistricting equitably allocates representation in Congress and state legislatures. However, this mid-decade effort appears to be a transparent power grab designed to lock in electoral advantages ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. 

Politicians in Washington are pressuring Indiana lawmakers to redraw these maps to benefit the White House and national political interests, not Hoosiers. This manipulation of district lines undermines democratic principles and risks diluting the voting power of communities across Indiana, especially communities of color. Politicians should earn electoral victories by engaging with constituents and championing good policies, not by redrawing maps to guarantee outcomes. Voters should choose their elected officials, not the other way around.

## Call Script
Hi, my name is [NAME] and I’m a constituent from [CITY, ZIP].

I’m contacting [REP/SEN NAME] to urge them to vote NO on HB 1032, mid-decade redistricting. Fair maps should reflect our communities and population changes, not the White House's political interests. 

Thank you for your time and consideration.
