# Should being Houseless be a Crime?

## Description

Under the bridge.  That’s the address of a significant number of the houseless population in Indiana.  If SB 285 is passed into law by Indiana legislators, the houseless population could  potentially be arrested, charged, and convicted of a Class C Misdemeanor crime.  The Bill is titled “Housing Matters,” and its intent would be to prohibit unauthorized camping, sleeping, or long term sheltering on public land owned by state or local governments.

A significant number of the houseless population have no other place to go.  There are many reasons why people become houseless including job loss, health crises, chronic illness, untreated mental issues, substance abuse disorders, or eviction for non-payment of rent or mortgage payments.  While the bill is designed to address the problem of houselessness, it does have some negative consequences:

* The bill would have local law enforcement officials issue a warning to those in houseless encampments and offer transportation to a shelter or connection with a local supportive service.  If encampment continues, houseless people could be charged with a Class C misdemeanor that could mean a fine and a jail sentence.  What if the local government doesn’t have adequate shelters or supportive agencies?  The law would still apply.
* If criminal charges result, the potential for this population would be further harmed in terms of being able to find employment or pass a background check for rental properties.  This bill could add insult to injury and doesn’t address any of the root causes for houselessness.
* The provisions in this bill apply statewide and would override any local policies that may be successful in the management of this population.   Smaller or more progressive cities would have to adhere to the new standards with a resulting increase in arrests, court cases, and jail bookings.
* The bill also requires annual reporting by local officials on arrests to the Indiana State Police.  ISP then reports this information to the Indiana Housing and Community Authority.  This department establishes eligibility criteria for federal housing funds going to houseless individuals.  Where will funding come from to administer these new bureaucratic requirements?
* Several years ago, Louisville, KY, established a “Homeless Court” that placed houseless populations into a separate legal entity that emphasized alternative placement and/or a recommendation that appropriate services be administered rather than issuing punishment.
