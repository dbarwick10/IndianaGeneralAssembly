Indiana Reproductive Health and Access Coalition Opposes SB 236
For Immediate Release: Jan. 27, 2026](https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/planned-parenthood-alliance-advocates/press-releases/indiana-reproductive-health-and-access-coalition-opposes-sb-236)

Indianapolis, IN — The Indiana Reproductive Health and Access Coalition (IRHAC) strongly opposes SB 236, a dangerous escalation of Indiana’s already extreme abortion ban. SB 236 passed out of the Senate Judiciary Committee last week despite hours of testimony reflecting widespread concern about the bill’s implementation and its impact on privacy, health care clinicians, and access to essential reproductive health care. Ignoring continued concerns, the full Senate voted to advance the bill again, 35-10, sending it to the House. 

Even with cosmetic amendments, SB 236 remains a sweeping pregnancy policing scheme that further erodes access to reproductive health care in Indiana. Hoosiers should not be misled by these surface-level revisions. This bill is still profoundly harmful, and here’s why:  

Creates a Texas-style “bounty hunter” legal environment that places a hefty price on Hoosier's private health care decisions. It allows private individuals to sue providers, pharmacists, manufacturers, or even friends and family members they believe are involved in medication abortion care, with the promise of financial rewards reaching hundreds of thousands of dollars. This structure invites surveillance, harassment, and unwanted legal exposure by strangers, unsupportive family members, and abusive partners.  

Allows the Indiana Attorney General to sue on behalf of the fetus, expanding the legal definition of personhood. It empowers the Indiana Inspector General, a non-health care appointee of Governor Braun, to review individual abortion complication reports, granting access to deeply personal medical information with the goal to identify violations of the Indiana abortion ban for prosecution. This will have a chilling effect for those who provide care to pregnant people and will increase the risks of patient harm and death. Court cases brought under SB 236 would rely on sensitive medical records, pregnancy timelines, digital history, and private communications—dragging pregnant people and their physicians into court without their consent.

By advancing illegitimate fetal personhood concepts, inserting contradicting abortion definitions, and intensifying civil liability tied to handling, shipping, and distributing medication abortion, SB 236 also creates a dangerous slippery slope that could threaten basic pregnancy care like contraception, IVF, miscarriage care, and medical privacy in the future.
