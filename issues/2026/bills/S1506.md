# Medicare for All

## Description
Compassion and Smart Business Align

It’s time for politicians to support healthcare for everyone. It makes sense morally and financially. Medicare for All, as represented in S. 1506, points in the right direction. It would save billions of dollars, save thousands of lives, and dramatically improve the quality of life in our country.  Rudy Yakym has leaned in – seeking to understand the need for dramatic change in our healthcare system and supporting this effort.  S. 1506 isn’t perfect but would improve access to care for our country.
 
The current healthcare system is profoundly flawed. It results in excessive cost, delayed care, and second-rate outcomes. Why is that 32 of 33 developed nations and one third of developing nations have been able to offer some kind of universal care with lower cost and better outcomes?  Our system of healthcare is not healthy. We should have learned that healthcare is not a commodity that can be vended on the open market like other retail products.
 
The current [Medicare Advantage plan](https://pnhp.org/system/assets/uploads/2024/06/MAHarmsOnePager_Color.pdf) requires complex prior authorizations resulting in unnecessary delays, denials, and limited service. We can do lots better and must!
 
The fundamental direction represented in S. 1506 is supported by many including 25,000 Physicians for a National Health Program and 225,000 members of National Nurses United. NNU is the largest union and professional association of registered nurses in U.S. history. This [press release](https://pnhp.org/news/doctors-welcome-the-medicare-for-all-act-of-2025/.) reflects their wisdom and support. It’s time to really fix the healthcare system---to actually create a system that incentivizes good self-care, improves the overall health of our nation, and delivers quality care not excessive profits to the few.

America is the largest democracy in the world that DOES NOT HAVE universal healthcare.
