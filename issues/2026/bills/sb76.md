# Immigration Matters

## Description

The Indiana Senate is working on a bill that would have extremely negative consequences for Indiana’s educational institutions, law enforcement, our immigrant neighbors, and our communities. Senate Bill 76 Immigration Matters would do the following: 
* Allow **law enforcement, government bodies, and public educational institutions** to use state funds and **be defended by the attorney general** if any of those institutions would face lawsuits **regarding action they took in complying with Indiana’s immigration enforcement law.**
* Allow **all levels of law enforcement** (local, state, federal) to **enforce federal immigration laws.** This component of the bill would require additional training for local law enforcement personnel and ultimately detract from their regular law enforcement responsibilities. 
* If an entity was found to be in violation of the enforcement law, it would allow
    * the **attorney general to sue** to halt the violation and apply fines.
    * the **governor to withhold state funding** (grants, appropriations) an institution normally receives from the state.
* Requires **any governmental body** that is detaining someone **to comply with an ICE detainer** request and requires judges to record that request in the individual’s case.
* Prohibits employers from “recklessly or intentionally” hiring undocumented workers, requiring them to report employees to DHS and to protect whistleblowers.
* Requires a **report of all undocumented individuals** who are enrolled in or receiving state benefits (medicaid, food stamps, etc).
* Mandates the department of corrections to **train any sheriff elect in cooperating with ICE**.

This bill does nothing to benefit Indiana residents who are in full compliance with State and Federal laws. In fact, having local law enforcement work with ICE personnel dilutes their ability to be effective in their own communities.

## Call Script
Hi, my name is [NAME] and I’m a constituent from [CITY, ZIP].

I’m contacting [REP/SEN NAME] to urge them to vote NO on SB 76 Immigration Matters. I have many concerns about this bill, including [choose several of the following concerns]:

* Legal advocates are concerned about the constitutionality of the state enforcing federal immigration laws, which could mean an increase in expensive legal challenges. I do not want me tax dollars used for this kind of unconstitutional defense
* This bill has the potential to increase discriminatory hiring practices by increasing fear of legal action and avoiding hiring legally qualified candidates who may have non-white sounding names. I want to ensure that our businesses continue to employ a diverse, well-qualified work force
* This bill could lead families to avoid accessing state services like medicaid and food stamps, creating a costly burden of care on already struggling rural hospital and health care systems. I want our state to continue providing accessible and appropriate funding to qualified members of our community to ensure healthy children and families. 
* This bill could take vital resources from our local law enforcement and detract from their vital roles in our community. I want our local law enforcement to focus on the safety of our community by doing the jobs they were trained to do and not be burdened by additional responsibilities of immigration enforcement.. 

Please keep federal immigration laws and enforcement where it belongs–at the federal level.
