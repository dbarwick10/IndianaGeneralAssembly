# IPS Public Education Corporation

## Description

Indiana House Bill 1423 would change how public schools in Indianapolis are governed by creating a new board appointed by the mayor to manage system-wide functions like school buildings, transportation, and some funding decisions. This board would oversee these services for all public schools within Indianapolis Public Schools (IPS) boundaries, including both traditional public schools and charter schools, while the elected IPS school board would keep control over daily school operations.

Concerns about the bill say it shifts significant authority away from an elected school board to an appointed body, which could reduce direct voter oversight of decisions involving taxes, debt, and public assets. This change weakens local control and limits the ability of parents and community members to influence decisions through elections.

Problematic ideas in this bill include question how a new governing layer would be held accountable to the public, how smooth responsibilities like building ownership and transportation would be transferred, and whether the change would simply add bureaucracy rather than improve services. There are also questions about how the new structure would affect equity, especially for communities that already feel disconnected from decision-making in public education.

## Call Script
Hi, my name is [NAME] and I’m a constituent from [CITY, ZIP].

I’m contacting [REP/SEN NAME] to urge them to vote NO on SB 76 Immigration Matters. I have many concerns about this bill, including [choose several of the following concerns]:

* Legal advocates are concerned about the constitutionality of the state enforcing federal immigration laws, which could mean an increase in expensive legal challenges. I do not want me tax dollars used for this kind of unconstitutional defense
* This bill has the potential to increase discriminatory hiring practices by increasing fear of legal action and avoiding hiring legally qualified candidates who may have non-white sounding names. I want to ensure that our businesses continue to employ a diverse, well-qualified work force
* This bill could lead families to avoid accessing state services like medicaid and food stamps, creating a costly burden of care on already struggling rural hospital and health care systems. I want our state to continue providing accessible and appropriate funding to qualified members of our community to ensure healthy children and families. 
* This bill could take vital resources from our local law enforcement and detract from their vital roles in our community. I want our local law enforcement to focus on the safety of our community by doing the jobs they were trained to do and not be burdened by additional responsibilities of immigration enforcement.. 

Please keep federal immigration laws and enforcement where it belongs–at the federal level.
