# Library Budgets

## Description

![From the Eckhart Public Library:
An open letter from our Executive Director Valerie:](https://www.facebook.com/eckhartpubliclibrary/posts/an-open-letter-from-our-executive-director-valerie-to-our-community-we-wanted-to/1331640858998415/)

To our community,
We wanted to offer some information about Senate Bill 8 (SB 8 ), its impact to public libraries, and what that means for our community.

Public libraries are a public service; we do not operate for a profit. We rely on public funds, or tax dollars, to provide the materials and opportunities that many in our community wouldn't have access to otherwise. With the passage of SEA 1 in 2025, public library funding has already been reduced.  With the addition of Senate Bill 8, our ability to maintain and grow services is at risk.

**The Current System**
For decades, our Board of Trustees has served as the official fiscal and governing body of the library. Board members are appointed by openly elected local officials. Strict state guardrails are followed to ensure every tax dollar is used legally and ethically.

**What SB 8 Changes**
New Thresholds: Currently, the state allows for the library’s Board of Trustees to grow the spendable budget of the library by 4.0% for 2026.
Binding Reviews: Under SB 8, if the library proposes a budget increase of 2.0% or more, it triggers a "Binding Review".
Budget Authority: Currently, reductions in a binding review are capped at 10%. SB 8 eliminates this cap,  allowing for unlimited cuts and modifications, which threatens to cripple growth and jeopardize essential services.

**Why This Matters**
Simply stated, SB 8 would limit the library’s ability to grow, or even maintain our services and plan for the future.  Eckhart Public Library hopes to support our vibrant, growing community as effectively as possible without the weight of additional limitations.
