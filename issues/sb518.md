# SB 518: School Property Taxes

## Description
SB 518 bill would require Indiana school corporations to share property tax revenue with charter schools located within their attendance areas. The legislation creates a multi-year implementation timeline requiring school corporations to distribute portions of their tax levies to qualified charter schools that serve students from their districts, starting with controlled project levies in May 2025, followed by debt service levies in 2026, and operations fund levies in 2028.

The bill establishes a formula for determining each charter school's share based on the number of students from the school corporation's attendance area who attend the charter school and receive less than 50% virtual instruction. The legislation phases in the percentage of revenue sharing over several years, with different implementation schedules based on how many students from a district attend charter schools.

Certain school corporations are exempted from the sharing requirements, including those designated as "distressed political subdivisions" and those with fewer than 100 students attending charter schools. The bill also requires charter schools receiving property tax revenue to add a board member appointed by the local government executive.

For charter schools that close, the legislation establishes procedures for returning property tax revenue and satisfying outstanding debt. It also adjusts how state charter school grant amounts are calculated, taking into account property tax revenue received.

This legislation represents a significant shift in Indiana education funding, allowing charter schools to access local property tax revenue that has traditionally been reserved exclusively for school corporations, and would take effect in phases between 2025 and 2028 if passed.

## Call Script
Hi, my name is [NAME] and Iâ€™m a constituent from [CITY, ZIP].

I'm calling to demand [REP/SEN NAME] oppose SB 518. This bill would force school corporations to share their property tax revenue with charter schools, setting a dangerous precedent that diverts critical funding away from our public schools. Public school districts already struggle with limited resources to serve all students, maintain facilities, and provide quality education. Charter schools operate with different oversight and selection criteria, yet this bill would entitle them to tax dollars collected specifically for public school needs. Instead of diverting resources from already underfunded public schools, we should focus on strengthening our public education system that serves all students regardless of circumstance or ability. 

Thank you for your time and consideration.
