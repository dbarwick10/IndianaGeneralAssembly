# HB 1393: Local Law Enforcement & Immigration

## Description
The bill requires the Attorney General to defend law enforcement officers, governmental bodies, or postsecondary educational institutions in civil suits arising from actions authorized or required by Indiana's immigration laws.
It mandates that governmental bodies with custody of individuals subject to immigration detainer requests must:

* Notify judges handling bail decisions
* Record the detainer in the individual's case file
* Comply with all requests in the detainer
* Inform the individual about the detainer

The legislation prohibits employers from knowingly or intentionally recruiting, hiring, or employing unauthorized aliens, with potential penalties including suspension or revocation of operating authorizations. Employers with 10+ employees in Indiana would be affected.

It requires "parole sponsors" (those who financially support immigrants paroled into the US) to submit annual documentation to the state, including copies of federal immigration forms and supporting materials.

The bill creates a system for the Attorney General to take action against governmental bodies that fail to comply with immigration detainer requests, including seeking civil penalties up to $10,000 per violation and potentially advising the governor to withhold state funding for up to one year.

The bill also provides civil immunity to governmental bodies and their employees for actions taken in compliance with immigration detainer requests, while establishing judicial record-keeping requirements regarding immigration detainers.

If passed, HB 1531 would significantly expand state involvement in immigration enforcement, creating new requirements for local governments, educational institutions, employers, and individuals sponsoring immigrants.

## Call Script
Hi, my name is [NAME] and I’m a constituent from [CITY, ZIP].

I’m calling to demand [REP/SEN NAME] oppose HB 1531. This bill removes the mens rea requirement, meaning authorities no longer need to prove that an entity or individual intended to violate immigration laws—only that a violation occurred. This unfairly penalizes local governments and businesses for unintentional mistakes and represents a gross overreach of state control. Additionally, allowing the Attorney General to seek the suspension or revocation of operating authorizations through court action will create a hostile environment for businesses, likely pushing them out of Indiana and harming our economy. Please oppose this harmful legislation.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
