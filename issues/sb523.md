# SB 518: School Chaplains

## Description
SB 523 would allow principals or superintendents of public schools, including charter schools, to employ or approve volunteers as school chaplains beginning July 1, 2025. The bill establishes qualifications for school chaplains, requiring them to pass background checks and possess a baccalaureate degree in divinity, theology, religious studies, or a related field, along with counseling experience.

School chaplains would be permitted to provide secular advice, guidance, and support services to students and employees. They could also provide nonsecular (religious) advice, but only with explicit permission from the recipient (adult students or employees) or from both the student and parent (for unemancipated minors).

The legislation establishes communications between students and chaplains as privileged and confidential, with two specific exceptions: chaplains must disclose to school counselors communications about a student's self-harm or intention to harm others. Additionally, the privileged communication protection would not apply in judicial proceedings related to child abuse or neglect reports.

The bill amends multiple sections of Indiana Code related to school staff responsibilities, confidential communications, and privileged information. It places school chaplains in similar legal standing to other school professionals like counselors and psychologists regarding confidentiality protections while establishing a new category of support personnel in Indiana public schools.

If passed, this legislation would create a formal role for religious professionals within Indiana's public education system while attempting to balance religious services with appropriate permissions and confidentiality protections.

## Call Script
Hi, my name is [NAME] and Iâ€™m a constituent from [CITY, ZIP].

I'm calling to demand [REP/SEN NAME] oppose SB 523. This bill would allow public schools to employ religious chaplains, severely undermining the constitutional separation of church and state in our education system. By permitting "nonsecular" guidance in taxpayer-funded institutions, it creates a dangerous precedent that could pressure vulnerable students and favor certain religious perspectives. Rather than introducing religious officials into our schools, we should strengthen existing mental health resources by investing in qualified, licensed school counselors and psychologists who serve all students equally, regardless of religious background, ensuring our public education system remains neutral and inclusive for families of all faiths or no faith.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
