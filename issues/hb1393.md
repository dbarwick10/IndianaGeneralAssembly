# HB 1393: Local Law Enforcement & Immigration

## Description
[From ACLU Indiana](https://www.aclu-in.org/en/legislation/immigration-notice):

Immigration enforcement is a federal responsibility. This bill would require every local and state law enforcement officer in Indiana to inappropriately stand in for federal immigration officers.  The result will be an increase in the profiling of Hoosiers based on race, appearance, and English proficiency.   

In addition, such laws actually harm public safety by eroding trust among immigrant communities. Immigrant communities in Indiana generally understand the different responsibilities of federal immigration enforcement officers and local police. By blurring these differences, HB 1393 will increase hesitation on the part of Hoosier immigrants to come forward as witnesses, provide crime tips, or seek police protection.
